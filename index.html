      <h1>Read this first</h1>
      <p>This project is in an early experimental stage. Everything related to this project is subject to change at any time. Our current <a href="https://github.com/AltCA/roots">root CA certificates</a> are temporary, will expire in August 2013 and will be replaced before that.
	When that happens, all CSRs will have to be re-processed with the new root CAs.
      <h1>If you're a user</h1>
      <p>AltCA.org is an alternate source of trust for Mac OS X Gatekeeper. Using our simple <strike>installer</strike> <a href="https://github.com/AltCA/setup/blob/master/setup.sh">shell script</a> you can configure Gatekeeper to
	trust certificates issued by us in addition to those issued by Apple. This gives you greater choice in what software you want
	to install on your computer, without giving up all the benefits of Gatekeeper and code signing.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you're willing to trust us (which you probably shouldn't at this point, unless you know <a href="http://dll.nu/">me</a> personally), run the following command in Terminal as an admin user to install our certificates using the above-mentioned shell script (you'll be asked for your password to authorize changing the system security policy):<br>
	<code>
	  curl 'https://raw.github.com/AltCA/setup/master/setup.sh' | bash
	</code>
      </p>
      <h1>If you're a developer</h1>
      <p>AltCA.org is an alternate certificate authority for Mac OS X Gatekeeper. If you are a free/open source software developer we will
	issue code signing certificates for free. Currently we issue certificates to people with a GitHub account and a proven track record
	of free software releases.
      </p>
      <p>
	To request an AltCA.org certificate (actually, you get two certificates; one for Installer packages and one for code signing), simply generate a CSR using the Certificate Assistant in Keychain Access. Save the CSR to a file. Fork the <a href="https://github.com/AltCA/csr">AltCA/csr</a> repositoy on GitHub. In your fork, create a sub-directory with a name equal to your GitHub username. In that directory, place your CSR and commit and push to your GitHub fork of the csr repo. Then open a GitHub pull request with the commit containing your CSR. We will review your CSR and if everything looks OK we will merge the pull request and at the same time place your new certificates in PEM format in our csr repository. You can then import those into your keychain and start signing software with them.
